* Parameter units are given in brackets after the names to help users.
* These default units are not strict limits and some can be modified easily and some with little care.
* One example of alternative units is the currency. Default unit says EUR, but it can be any currency unit.
* Also MW of generation and MWh of storages can be used to model e.g. tons of emissions without
* changing any code, but in this case the modeller must be careful to not mix up units.
