# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New model setting `dataLength` to set the length of time series data before it is
  recycled. Warn if this is not defined and automatically calculated from data.
- Added sample dimension to most variables and equations (excl. investments). 
  Samples can now be used as long-term scenario alternatives (for e.g. hydro scehduling)
- Number of parallel samples can be reduced using SCENRED2. Activate with active('scenRed')
  and set parameters in modelsInit.

### Changed
- Automatic calculation of parameter `dt_circular` takes into account time steps 
  only from `t000001` onwards.

### Fixed
- Calculation of parameter `df_central`
- Readability of some displayed messages 


## 1.0 - 2018-09-12
