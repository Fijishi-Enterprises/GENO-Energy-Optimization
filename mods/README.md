## Backbone mods

Backbone allows adding new parameters, set, equations, objective functions, and result tables through input data files. This mod folder is delivered as a part of the main model and includes the code files for few selected mods. Example data sets for these mods are distributed in https://gitlab.vtt.fi/backbone/backbone/-/wikis/Getting-started/Example%20models
