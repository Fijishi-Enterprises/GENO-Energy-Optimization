## Details on equations

### Objectives

all objective equations contain
- quantity to be counted/measured +
- penalties (energy balance, reserve provision, capacity margin) +
- slack variable * small scalar


### Constraints

all constraint equations are formulated as equalities, not inequalities, and contain
- quantity to be counted/measured +
- slack variable

### Cost

- based on "normal" objective function
- just added the slack variable and small scalar

### Emission

- 

### Generation

- sums up generation from inputs or outputs of units in a uGroup
- sums up all uGroups for which the new parameter objectiveWeight is defined
- the generation of each uGroup is mulitplied with the objectiveWeight
